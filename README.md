# Firestick Cleanup

Automated tool to replace the ad-filled Amazon Fire TV launcher with [Projectivy Launcher](https://github.com/nickaknudson/tv.projectivy.launcher) and disable Amazon bloatware — no root required.

## What It Does

1. Connects to your Fire TV over ADB (WiFi)
2. Downloads and installs the latest Projectivy Launcher
3. Configures Projectivy as the default launcher
4. Asks which optional Amazon apps you want to keep (Music, Photos, Appstore, etc.)
5. Disables all tracking/telemetry/bloat automatically + your optional choices
6. Reboots, verifies persistence, and re-applies anything Amazon re-enables
7. Shows before/after RAM comparison

## Prerequisites

### ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

ADB is **bundled** in the `adb/` folder — no separate installation needed. The script automatically uses the bundled copy.

### Enable ADB on Fire TV

1. Go to **Settings > My Fire TV > About**
2. Click **Fire TV Stick** (the device name) 7 times to enable Developer Options
3. Go back to **Settings > My Fire TV > Developer Options**
4. Enable **ADB Debugging**
5. Enable **Apps from Unknown Sources**
6. Note your Fire TV's IP address from **Settings > My Fire TV > About > Network**

## Usage

### Install & Clean Up

Double-click `Firestick-Cleaner-And-Launcher-Replacer.bat` or run from command prompt:

```
Firestick-Cleaner-And-Launcher-Replacer.bat
```

### Revert All Changes

```
Firestick-Cleaner-And-Launcher-Replacer.bat --revert
```

This re-enables all disabled packages, removes Projectivy, and restores all settings to stock.

## What Gets Disabled

The script splits packages into two categories:

- **Always disabled** — Tracking, telemetry, ads, and background services. These are always removed with no prompt.
- **Optional (Y/N prompt)** — Apps you might actually use (Amazon Music, Photos, Appstore, etc.). The script asks you for each one before disabling.

Some packages may be protected by Amazon on certain firmware versions — the script handles these gracefully and reports them.

### Ads, Tracking & Telemetry

### Protected by Amazon (Cannot Disable Without Root)

These packages are protected at the system level. The script detects and skips them automatically:

| Package | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `com.amazon.tv.launcher` | **Stock Launcher** — Amazon's home screen (runs in background ~110 MB) |
| `com.amazon.device.software.ota` | **OTA Updates** — Fire OS update service |
| `com.amazon.device.metrics` | **Core Metrics** — system-level metrics collection |

| `com.amazon.device.logmanager` | **Log Manager** — system log management |
| `com.amazon.device.sync` | **Device Sync** — syncs device state with Amazon |
| `com.amazon.securitysyncclient` | **Security Sync** — security policy sync service |
| `com.amazon.tv.csapp` | **Customer Service App** — Amazon support app |
| `com.amazon.tv.oobe` | **Out of Box Experience** — initial setup wizard |

## How It Works

Amazon protects the stock launcher as a system package, so it cannot be disabled or uninstalled without root. Instead, Projectivy uses an **Android Accessibility Service** to intercept the Home button press and redirect it to Projectivy's home screen.

The script:
1. Enables `ProjectivyAccessibilityService` via `settings put secure`
2. Assigns the `android.app.role.HOME` role to Projectivy
3. Grants overlay (`SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`) and notification listener permissions
4. Disables bloatware in a loop — if some packages are protected, it reboots and retries in case new ones become available
5. After rebooting, re-applies any disables that Amazon reverted during the reboot

After installation, you need to configure Projectivy on the TV:
1. Open Projectivy **Settings** (long-press the center/select button on the remote)
2. Go to **General**
3. Enable **Override current launcher**

This ensures the Home button always opens Projectivy instead of the Amazon launcher.

## Notes

- **Fire TV updates** may reset these changes. Consider blocking OTA updates at the router level by blocking `softwareupdates.amazon.com` and `fireos-fireos-update.s3.amazonaws.com`.
- All changes are **fully reversible** — run with `--revert` to undo everything.
- The stock Amazon launcher remains running in the background (~110 MB RAM) since Amazon protects it from being disabled. This is unavoidable without root.
- Settings persist through reboots. The script verifies this automatically.
- Tested on Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Stick Lite.
